# msc-dissertation-computational-social-choice
This repository contains my final dissertation for the MSc in Mathematics, at Birkbeck, University of Lonon. The focus of the dissertation was on a topic at the intersection of Mathematics, Economics and Theoretical CS; Computational Social Choice Theory. The work is purely theoretical but I have included implementation of various Social Choice Algorithms/Voting Mechanisms in Python.
